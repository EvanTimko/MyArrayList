# MyArrayList
This is The ArrayList recoded with my personal touch with some method being left out and some new method being added into it, also I used a generic, so one can pass a parameter type or leave it raw type

# Basics

So in ArrayList there is a class called ArrayList1 where my personal ArrayList Structure can be found, Also there is a test folder where you can see my test cases(run it, to see)

One more thing, there are two readMe files one is ArrayListTutorial, which is just going over the basic ArrayList and showing how it works, the other is MyArrayListTutorial is explaining my ArrayList1 and how it works and given a good basic understanding the ArrayList data structure
